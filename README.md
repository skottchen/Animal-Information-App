# Animal Information App
A React app with Typescript that uses GET requests to display random facts and pictures of cats and dogs. <br>

To run:
1. Import the code into VSCode (or any code editor of your choice) <br>
2. To set up React, use the command "npm i -D @types/react" in the terminal.  
3. Use the commands "npm i" then "npm run dev" in the terminal. <br>
4. Click on the localhost link. 

Note: If a picture is not showing up on the app it is likely that the original API is broken or has been deleted.
